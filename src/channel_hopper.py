# TODO: Integrate the channel hopper into main.py

# TODO: This needs sudo or root access to work. That might be a problem when used with everything else?

# TODO: There might be a bug where after having run "sudo airmon-ng start <interface>", the interface drops back to
#  managed after some time. I haven't been able to reproduce it or force it.
#  Possible solution: Airmon says that there are some processes that might interfere and switch the interface back to
#  managed mode. It might be possible to kill those processes and solve this issue.
